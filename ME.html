		<h3>Hello everyone...</h3>
		<p>My name is Reginald Barbour, I am an englishman currently living in Croatia. 21 years have past since my birthday and boy have they gone by quickly. I am a student living away from home studying the science of environmental engineering in the city of Vara≈ædin.</p>
		<p>The world of photography came to me in the most ironic of places, a place where beautiful things are not so common, a place of hope and of despair, a place where life has been given and unfortunately taken, yes, a hostpital. It's incredible what a person goes through during his/her stay in such a place.. As the days past I became more aware of my blessings and how beautiful the world we live in really is. My operation didn't just change the way I looked, it changed my life. </p>
		<p>I see myself as a modern and artistic photographer, capturing the details in day to day life, all my photos are authentic and true to this world. There are no rules in this line of work, there are no limits, all that matters is what and how you feel about the specific moment in time. My pictures have no order, they have no schedule but in the end they all come together to form one great big story about me.</p>
		<h3>Thank you for your time...</h3>
